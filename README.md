## AES-Encryption-Decryption
<b>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</b>

An algorithm that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt protected data. Instead of a single round of encryption, data is put through 
several rounds of substitution, transposition, and mixing to make it harder to compromise.That means it takes 128 bits as input and outputs 
128 bits of encrypted cipher text as output. AES relies on substitution-permutation network principle which means it is performed using a 
series of linked operations which involves replacing and shuffling of the input data.
